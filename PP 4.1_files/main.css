    I agree that this may be not the most efficient, object-oriented and

    First is the title step with a big <h1> (no room for padding) and some
    3D positioning along Z axis.

    And as the last thing there is a workaround for quite strange bug.
    It happens a lot in Chrome. I don't remember if I've seen it in Firefox.
    
    Sometimes the element positioned in 3D (especially when it's moved back
    along Z axis) is not clickable, because it falls 'behind' the <body>
    element.
    
    To prevent this, I decided to make <body> non clickable by setting
    pointer-events property to `none` value.
    Value if this property is inherited, so to make everything else clickable
    I bring it back on the #impress element.
    
    If you want to know more about `pointer-events` here are some docs:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events
    
    There is one very important thing to notice about this workaround - it makes
    everything 'unclickable' except what's in #impress element.
    
    So use it wisely ... or don't use at all.
